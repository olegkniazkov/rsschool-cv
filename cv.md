## About me
I started my professional life as radar system disigner when I was a student. Then I worked for 1 year in telecommuniction in Southern regional search and rescue service in Sochi. I was excited to use and maintaince professional radiocommunication systems in my homeland mountains. I became a tourist, I enjoyed hiking a lot at that days.
For year I worked as system administrator. Then I switched to securuty industry and worked for 15 years in this area.
So that I have good hard skills, because I worked with hardware a lot and I developed soft skills because of work in different roles and in various professional areas.
I have had two goals for several years:
 1. learn to program;
 2. to speak English fluently.

I work hard to achieve my goals.
